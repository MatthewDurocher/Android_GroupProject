# Android_GroupProject
Group project for CST 3104. Our task is to finish development of the seed project.


## Initial Changes

1. I converted the project to Kotlin!

> For the most part, the framework works exactly the same way in Java. But now we can take 
> advantage of the quality-of-life that Kotlin bestows :)

2. I'll be implementing "View Binding" instead of the old `getElementById('abkjlshblahdjaf')` stuff.

> It's a minor difference in how Views are accessed. 
> You can see the changes needed in the commit log to see exactly what get's replaced
